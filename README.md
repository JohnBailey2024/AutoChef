# AutoChef

Welcome to our AutoChef repository! This project aims to provide users with personalized recipe recommendations based on their input ingredients. 

## Team Members

- **John Bailey**: Developed and implemented the Streamlit interface.
- **Nihtin Kumar**: Identified and preprocessed the training dataset.
- **James Chun**: Established and formatted the project's GitHub repository.
- **Felix Tong**: Authored the model and backend code.

## Project Overview

Right now AutoChef takes in a list of ingredients from the user and suggests recipes from a dataset containing similar ingredients. We utilize word embeddings to match input ingredients with recipes in the dataset.

### Features

- **Streamlit Interface**: Users can input ingredients via a user-friendly Streamlit interface and receive curated recipe recommendations.
- **Preprocessed Dataset**: The training dataset has been preprocessed to ensure optimal model performance.
- **GitHub Repository**: Our project repository is organized and formatted for efficient collaboration and version control.
- **Model and Backend**: The recommendation system's model and backend code have been developed to enable recipe suggestions based on input ingredients.

## Future Enhancements

Moving forward, our team aims to enhance the system's capabilities by training the model to generate entirely new recipes. We will focus on ensuring that the generated recipes are coherent and palatable, avoiding clashing flavors or inedible combinations.

## Getting Started
